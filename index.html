   <h1>Sigmas of the world: Unite you nigs</h1> 
   <p>Senator Payman called on the “sigmas of Australia” to say “this goofy ahh government have been capping” when they talked about no more “fanum tax.”

    “They are capaholics,” she said.
    “They are also yapaholics.”

    She said the government “yapped non-stop” about its cost of living measures improving the lives of all Australian.
    
    “Just put the fries in the bag lil bro,” she said.
    
    “They must have brainrot from watching too much Kai Cenat and forgot about their plans to ban social media for kids under 14.
    “If that becomes law you can forgor ‘skull emoji’ all about watching Duke Dennis or catching a dub with the bros on Fort.

    “Chat, is this prime minister serious?”
    
    The senator added that she would be taking a nail if she did not mention the “opps” who wanted to cut WA’s “gyatts and services tax.”
    “The decision voters will be making in a few months time will be between a mid government and a dog water opposition or a cross bench that will mog both of them,” she said.

    “Though some of you cannot yet vote, I hope when you do, it will be in a more goated Australia, for a government with more aura. Skibidi.
    
    “It is for this reason that I shall now render the remainder of my statement in a language they can understand.”
